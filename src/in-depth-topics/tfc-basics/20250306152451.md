# Basic Health Care
Many kind of things will consistently bother you, namely health, hunger, hydration, and body temperature. Health is self-explanatory, with max health being able to be increased by balanced diet. There are 5 categories of nutrition: Grain, Protein, Fruit, Vegetable, and Dairy. Each food has its own value of nutrients. Since it is hard to maintain being nourished, some options for merging foods like sandwiches or salads are available.

Hunger is something like the amount of actions you can do without dying. When hunger is low, screen becomes greish and you cannot run. Hydration is similar to hunger, but drains a bit faster and requires fresh water. When hydration is low, you'll get low speed and mining fatigue debuff.

Body temperature is by far the most intricate factor; you'll die if body temperature gets higher than 30 Celsius degree(heatstroke), or lower than 0 Celsius degree(froze to death). A small triangle over the hot bar is the indicator of it: blue for cold, red (or orange) for hot. Crouch anywhere and you'll see your current body temperature and target temperature, in the format of `15.0℃ -> 13.7℃`. This means that if you stay where you are, your body temperature will fall down to 13.7℃. It will rise and fall according to the climate temperature. Additionally, nearby blocks, such as hot stuffs like machines, lava, forge, or cold stuffs like snow, water will increase or decrease your body temperature. Normally, it's best to remain as close as 15℃.
