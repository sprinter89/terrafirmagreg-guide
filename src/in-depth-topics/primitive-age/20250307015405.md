# Place to Sleep
In TerrafirmaGreg, there's two options for place to sleep: a thatch bed and a wool bed. Since it is hard to get wools, a thatch bed would be the only option in early-game. Being easy to make, you cannot sleep through night with it. A wool bed does not have this disadvantage.

## Thatch Bed
A thatch bed is an early-game solution for spawnpoint. It is kind of a multiblock but simple: it consists of 2 thatch blocks, which are just 4 straws combined, and large raw hide, which can be acquired from big predators. Straws are from grasses using a knife. To form a thatch bed, place down 2 thatch blocks, and right-click with large raw hide onto it. It will show a toast text that reads "This bed is too uncomfortable to sleep, but your spawnpoint was set." You can die from countlessly many things in TFG, so grab it as soon as possible
