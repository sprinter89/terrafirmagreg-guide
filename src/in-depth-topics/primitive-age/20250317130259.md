# Mining
In TerrafirmaGreg, mining is unbelievably dangerous. Rocks can cave-in, and monsters or hazarduos materials can easily kill you. In this section, you'll get to know how to deal with all those disasters, with collecting significantly more resources.

## Cave-ins
First things first, you should know about cave-ins. A cave-in is undoubtedly dangerous, for rocks above your head will just fall and squash you.

There is a chance for a cave-in ifâ€¦
1. You break a raw rock.
2. An unsupported rock is nearby, specifically in the range of 9x5x9.

The term *unsupported* means that a rock is airborne, without any blocks that could defy gravity underneath it. For example, a rock on a cobblestone is unsupported, because a cobblestone gets affected by gravity. If it were a wood plank, which does not fall by itself, the rock would have been supported. Also, support beams can make any blocks supported within their range, though it cannot block already falling blocks.

These conditions suggest many things. As the first condition says, cave-ins are activated only if a rock is broken; it does not matter to make supported rocks unsupported. Also, cave-ins can be completely prevented by covering the cave, so that cobblestones cannot fall onto you. Moreover, digging straight down will be safe in the most cases, as it won't make any rocks airborne.

Even though you trigger a cave-in, it is just a small chance, which is low enough to break three rocks horizontally. The fact that you can safely break three rocks is important because it is the minimum area you need to place support beams for preventing cave-ins.

## Support Beams
Support beams are the cheapest way to support blocks. Any horizontal support beams will support 9x5x9 area. The range of 9x5x9 can be interpreted as it supporting 4 blocks each in left, right, front, and back, and 2 blocks up and down in y axis. Horizontal support beams however cannot be put independently; it requires any vertical support beams which are one to 5 blocks apart.

It's safe to remove and replace support beams, given that you don't break any rocks without them.
