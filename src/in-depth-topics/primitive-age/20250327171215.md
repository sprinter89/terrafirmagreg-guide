# Primitive Ore Processing
Unlike normal Terrafirmacraft, you can process ores to get the full of ores. However, you cannot do much for now. This section is just for the first glance of the full Gregtech ore processing.

Ore processing starts with a crushed ore. A crushed ore can be acquired by breaking ores with a hammer. Now it can be hammered into an impure ore dust, or washed to get a purified crushed ore by throwing it into water or using it onto a cauldron with water. An impure dust can be washed into a full dust, and a purified crushed ore can be hammered into a purified ore dust, which can be further washed into a full dust.

For now, these processes seem to be meaningless; they do not give any byproducts, although they give more than the previous raw ores. These processes will be replaced by a number of machines, giving you much more byproducts in the expense of the power and time costs.
