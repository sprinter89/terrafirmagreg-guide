# Heating
There are multiple ways to heat up things. This section will cover all the ways that generates heat.

## Pit Kiln
Pit Kiln is a way to heat up things directly to Yellow White ****. You need 8 straws and 8 logs, with enough patience to wait 8 minutes. Dig a small one-block hole and place down the items you want to heat up. There is a special key for placing an item on a block. Normally 4 items are maximum. Place 8 straws and 8 logs on top of them, and set on a fire. You may see the remaining time on top of the screen.

## Charcoal Forge
Charcoal forge is an improved way to heat up things. You need 5 stone blocks, including cobblestones, raw stones, and stone bricks. Dig a hole and replace 5 blocks surrounding the hole with stones. Place 7 or 8 charcoal into the hole by right-clicking, and set on a fire onto it. You'll now see that the texture has been changed like a magma block.

Opening the charcoal forge by right-clicking, you'll see there are 10 slots in V shape and 4 slots on the right side vertically. The 10 slots are for items to heat up and fuels, 5 each. Side 4 slots are for containers like vessels, molds, etc. Put 2 or more ingot molds for safety!
