# Knapping
You first have to make some stone tools. You need at least an axe, a knife to progress. A shovel will help you a lot when getting some clays.

To make stone tools, pick up some wood sticks and stones fallen around. You have to pick up two or more stones of the same type to *knap* them.

Knapping is a special way of creating things. Hold the stones and right-click, and 5x5 knapping UI will appear. Click the following cells to get a stone axe head. But watch out! As soon as you start to knap a single cell, you use one stone. Failing to make a tool head will lose the stone.
