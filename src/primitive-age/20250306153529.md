# Knapping
Knapping is a special way of shaping things. In 5x5 knapping UI, you click cells to be removed. If the recipe is correct, you'll receive the item you've made. In most of the cases, failing to make an item will lose the original material.

There are four cases in which you knap: stone, clay, leather, and horn. The first two is the most important part of knapping. You can find those recipes in JEI.

## Stone Knapping
Holding the same kind of more than one stones, right-click. 5x5 knapping UI will appear. Click the following cells to get a stone axe head. But watch out! As soon as you start to knap a single cell, you use one stone. Failing to make a tool head will lose the stone.
