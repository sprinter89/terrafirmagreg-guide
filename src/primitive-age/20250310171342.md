# The Bronze Age
## Alloying Bronze
Simply put, alloying is mixing materials. Some materials require specific ratio of specific materials, and bronze is the first alloy you'll make. There are 3 kinds of bronze: plain bronze with copper and tin, bismuth bronze with copper, bismuth, and zinc, and balck bronze with copper, silver, and gold. As you proceed, you must make all the different bronzes.

In TerrafirmaGreg, the plain bronze will be the best option, which is just a mixture of copper and tin. The required raito of materials can be navigated in the alloying[^6] tab in JEI. More easily, just put some stacks of copper and tin in vessel and hover over it. If it says it forms bronze, heat the vessel in the way you did to copper. One pitfall is that a vessel has its maximum capacity of 3000 mB. Any material more than that will just vanish, so don't be greedy.

After alloying a bronze, cast 46 ingots, 14 for a new anvil, and 32 for a bloomery, which will be covered later. Smelt the previous copper anvil if you want to, noting that it takes ridiculously long time to do.
