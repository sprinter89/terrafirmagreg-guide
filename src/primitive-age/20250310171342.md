# The Bronze Age
This is just a intermediate step to the wrought iron age. Nothing is special with bronze, though you're going to use this quite a lot as a fluid pipe or rotor.

## Alloying Bronze
Alloy plain bronze by mixing copper and tin.

Simply put, alloying is mixing materials. Some materials require specific ratio of specific materials, and bronze is the first alloy you'll make. There are 3 kinds of bronze: plain bronze with copper and tin, bismuth bronze with copper, bismuth, and zinc, and balck bronze with copper, silver, and gold. Plain bronze is the most popular and versatile in TerrafirmaGreg, while you have to make the other kinds of bronze.

The required raito of materials can be navigated in the alloying tab in JEI. More easily, just put some stacks of copper and tin in vessel and hover over it. If it says it forms bronze, heat the vessel in the way you did to copper. One pitfall is that a vessel has its maximum capacity of 3000 mB. Any material more than that will just vanish, so don't be greedy.

After alloying a bronze, cast 46 ingots, 14 for a new anvil, and 32 for a [bloomery](./20250310171355.md#bloomery-and-processing-blooms). Smelt the previous copper anvil if you want to, noting that it takes ridiculously long time to do.

## Tier II: Bronze Anvil
Make a bronze anvil with 7 bronze ingots.

Nothing is special here. You can forge bronze tools with it.
