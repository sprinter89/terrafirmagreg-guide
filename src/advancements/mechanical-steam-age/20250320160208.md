# The Mechanical-Steam Age
Welcome to the world of Create/Gregtech! You can finally start making some contraptions which will skip million years of human history.

You may notice this age is called the mechanical-steam age. It is because you have to progress simultaneously. Your first Gregtech machine would have been Coke oven, which gives you 1:1 ratio of charcoal. Other than that requires some kind of power generator, like a steam boiler. A low pressure steam boiler is the first possible power generator you can make, and it is quite viable until you run more than two machines at the same time. After making some Gregtech machines, Create cogwheel gets unlocked. Create contraptions will be required for the progression to LV, the first electornic age you will undergo.

There's no big difference between low pressure steam boiler and high pressure one. They just differ in the amount of steam production, with minor fuel efficiency difference. So in most cases, using high pressure machines on a low pressure boiler has no problem, except that it will use more steam than a low pressure boiler produces. Thankfully, a boiler has buffer to save some of the steam. Also, all steam machines are high pressure machines, so it will be often omitted in this section.

The first goal in here is to make a mechanical press from Create. It cuts the cost of making a plate almost by half: 1.1875 ingots per plate. It requires an iron block, which has to be made in a high pressure alloy smelter. So, the first Gregtech machine (that requires some power) would be an alloy smelter.

After making a mechanical press, you can run it with a hand crank. Unless you live around a river, getting rotational power automatically would be pretty difficult. A mechanical press will (literally) press an item that is under the block. If its piston does not extend, check if the item is in the block right below. Disappointingly enough, it has a 20% chance of failure: it will give you back a small pile of dust, which accounts for 25% of an ingot.

To prevent tragedy that you have barely not enough resources to do something, batch craft as much as possible. Most of the things in this game require things in the figure of 3 digits. Just stockpile them, and do not try to make things on-demand. It seems that wasting resources is much better than saving resources by making on-demand, partially because most of them will become infinite in the later game.

The next thing you would want to do is divided into two objectives: making a cogwheel and increasing the effficiency of the blast furnace. The former requires a macerator and a compressor. A macerator is a machine which crush things into dusts. This can be used for macerating raw ores, but hammer mining or a crushing wheel is much efficient than that, except for the small ores you can pick up from the ground. In cogwheel making, it will macerate creosote-treated wood planks, which can be made from planks in a sealed barrel with creosote, into a treated wood pulp. A compressor will compress the pulp into a treated wood planks, which now can be used for cogwheels by crafting it with a shaft.

The latter is of making more fire bricks for the chimney. Unlike before, its recipe gets much cheaper, only requiring clays to get one. However, being cheaper does not mean it's easier; it is significantly complicated. The change in fire brick recipe requires a steam furnace and a macerator. Fire brick is now made by smelting a compressed fire clay brick, which can be made by merging a brick dust and a clay dust in a crafting table, which can be acquired by macerating a clay brick block and a clay ball respectively. A compressor will reduce the cost of a clay brick block into 4 bricks.
