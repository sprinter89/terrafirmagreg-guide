# The Mechanical-Steam Age
Welcome to the world of Create/Gregtech! You can finally start making some contraptions which will skip million years of human history.

You may notice this age is called the mechanical-steam age. It is because you have to progress in parallel. Your first Gregtech machine would have been coke oven, which gives you 1:1 ratio of charcoal. Other than that requires some kind of power generator, like a steam boiler. A low pressure steam boiler is the first possible power generator you can make. With some Gregtech machines, Create cogwheel gets unlocked. While cogwheels itself is not required, deployer is required for making the first circuits. Also, Create contraptions will be really helpful for the progression to LV, the first electornic age you will undergo.

The first rule of thumb from now on is to batch craft as much as possible. This is for preventing tragedy where you have not enough resources to do something. Most of the things in this game demand you to have things in the figure of 3 digits at minimum. It would be smart to just stockpile them, and not to try to make things on-demand. It may seem that wasting resources is much better than saving resources by making on-demand, partially because most of them will become infinite in the later game.

First of all, every machine (except for coke oven) requires some kind of power. In the mechanical-steam age, the source of power is steam, as you may expect. It is generated from boilers.
