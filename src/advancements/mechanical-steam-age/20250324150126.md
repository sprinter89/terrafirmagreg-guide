# Mechanical Press
The first goal in here is to make a mechanical press. It cuts off the cost of making a plate almost by half: 1.1875 ingots per plate. It requires an iron block, which has to be made in a high pressure alloy smelter. So, the first Gregtech machine in the mechanical/steam age would be an alloy smelter. You can run it with a hand crank. Unless you live around a river, getting rotational power automatically would be pretty difficult. A mechanical press will (literally) press an item that is under the block. If its piston does not extend, check if the item is in the block right below. Disappointingly enough, it has a 20% chance of failure: it will give you back a small pile of dust, which accounts for 25% of an ingot.

The next thing you would want to do is divided into two objectives: making a cogwheel and increasing the effficiency of the blast furnace.
