# Unlocking Cogwheel
Making a cogwheel requires a macerator and a compressor, not to mention a coke oven. A macerator is a machine which crush things into dusts. It will macerate creosote-treated wood planks, which can be made from planks in a sealed barrel with creosote, into a treated wood pulp. A compressor will compress the pulp into a treated wood planks, which now can be used for cogwheels by crafting it with a shaft.

Cogwheel unlocks the full world of Create. Take a look at:
* Mechanical pump with hose pulley: supply infinite water and lava to prevent boilers from exploding
* Kapok tree farm: you will need a TON of them, especially from MV
* Rolling mill: the cheapest rod recipe
* Mechanical saw: now we have 4 planks from 1 wood

Also, now that you have a macerator, consider giving a look at ore processing.
