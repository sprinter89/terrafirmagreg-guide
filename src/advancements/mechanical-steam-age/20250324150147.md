It will macerate creosote-treated wood planks, which can be made from planks in a sealed barrel with creosote, into a treated wood pulp. A compressor will compress the pulp into a treated wood planks, which now can be used for cogwheels by crafting it with a shaft.

* Kapok tree farm: you will need a TON of them, especially from MV
* Rolling mill: the cheapest rod recipe
* Mechanical saw: now we have 4 planks from 1 wood
