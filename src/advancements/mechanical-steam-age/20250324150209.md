# Upgrading a Blast Furnace
This is of making more fire bricks for the chimney. Unlike the recipe using fire clay, its recipe gets much cheaper, only requiring normal clay balls to get one. However, being cheaper does not mean it's easier; it is significantly complicated. Actually, this is the whole point of Gregtech: cheaper, more complicated. The change in fire brick recipe requires a steam furnace and a macerator. Fire brick is now made by smelting a compressed fire clay brick, which can be made by merging a brick dust and a clay dust in a crafting table, which can be acquired by macerating a clay brick block and a clay ball respectively. A compressor will reduce the cost of a clay brick block into 4 bricks.
