# Introduction to TerrafirmaGreg
TerrafirmaGreg is a modpack which incorporates two major mods, Terrafirmacraft and GregTech, with many other supplementary mods. The former vastly changes your survival experience, adding new systems and terrains and mods and etc., and the latter helps you automate almost (or literally) every element existing. It might be frustrating though, if you don't know enough necessary information to advance. So this guide will let you know how to and what to do things you need to do.
