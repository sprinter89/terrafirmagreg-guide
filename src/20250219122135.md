# Introduction to TerrafirmaGreg
TerrafirmaGreg is a modpack which incorporates two major mods, Terrafirmacraft and GregTech, with many other supplementary mods. The former vastly changes your survival experience, adding new systems and terrains and mods and etc., and the latter helps you automate almost (or literally) every element existing. It might be frustrating though, if you don't know enough necessary information to advance. So this guide will let you know how to and what to do things you need to do.

## Readme.md
This book is designed to be read as a field-guide. I divided this book into two categories: advancement and individual topics. I tried to keep those topics as atomic as possible, but because of the way this game is, it's imperfect. Keep this in mind.

The former part consists of a number of sections, divided by the material / tier you are with. Each section has a few entry, each made up of the goal of it, and brief explanation. If it is insufficient or lacking some important details, feel free to navigate through this guide, for I will cover everything I know at least once in somewhere, or through JEI.
