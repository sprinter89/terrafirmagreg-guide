# Special Recipes


## Knapping
Knapping is a special way of shaping things. Holding enough amount of a specific material, right click and knapping UI will appear. In 5x5 knapping UI, you click cells you want to be removed. Failing to make an item will lose the original material, except for clay.

There are four cases in which you knap: stone, clay, leather, and horn. The first two is the most important part of knapping. You can find those recipes in JEI.
