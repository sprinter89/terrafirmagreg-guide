# Climate
Climate is an important factor of which plants and animals would live. It is calculated from two factors: temperature and hydration.
Regional temperature is again set by three factors: latitude(Z coordinate), season, and daily time, in which latitude is the strongest. Usually going north(Z -) lowers regional temperature, and south(Z +) increases. It seems that around Z: 5000 is set to be the equator of a world.
Hydration is mainly calculated by longitude(X coordinate). Going east(X +) increases it while going west(X -) decreases.
