# The Primitive Age

## Basic Health Care
Many kind of things will consistently bother you, namely health, hunger, hydration, and body temperature. Health is self-explanatory, with max health being able to be increased by balanced nutrition. Hunger is something like the amount of actions you can do without dying. When hunger is low, screen becomes greish and you cannot run. Hydration is similar to hunger, but drains a bit faster and requires fresh water. When hydration is low, you'll get low speed and mining fatigue debuff.

Body temperature is by far the most intricate factor; you'll die if body temperature gets higher than 30 Celsius degree(heatstroke), or lower than 0 Celsius degree(froze to death). A small triangle over the hot bar is the indicator of it: blue for cold, red (or orange) for hot. Crouch anywhere and you'll see your current body temperature and target temperature, in the format of `15.0℃ -> 13.7℃`. This means that if you stay where you are, your body temperature will fall down to 13.7℃. It will rise and fall according to the climate temperature. Additionally, nearby blocks, such as hot stuffs like machines, lava, forge, or cold stuffs like snow, water will increase or decrease your body temperature. Normally, it's best to remain as close as 15℃.

Don't forget to manage these factors!

## Stone Tools
You first have to make some stone tools. You need at least an axe, a knife to progress. A shovel will help you a lot when getting some clays.

To make stone tools, pick up some wood sticks and stones fallen around. You have to pick up two or more stones of the same type to *knap* them.

Knapping is a special way of creating things. Hold the stones and right-click, and 5x5 knapping UI will appear. Click the following cells to get a stone axe head. But watch out! As soon as you start to knap a single cell, you use one stone. Failing to make a tool head will lose the stone.

Stone axe is for chopping a tree, and stone knife is for gathering thatch, which is used for pit kiln.

With those tool heads, place them vertically to make stone tools. Congratulations! You now have a fundamental tools to start.

## Thatch Bed
A thatch bed is an early-game solution for spawnpoint. It consists of 2 thatch blocks, which are just 4 straws combined, and large raw hide, which can be acquired from big predators. To form a thatch bed, place down 2 thatch blocks consequtively, and right-click with large raw hide onto it. It will show a toast text that "This bed is too uncomfortable to sleep, but your spawnpoint was set." You can die from countlessly many things in here, so grab it as soon as possible.

## Kaolin Clays?
It is strongly recommended to find kaolin clay before you make a house. It is found in hot and wet climate, and in high altitude. Going south east would work. You can know when kaolin clay is nearby by blood lily, a flower that only grows around kaolin clay. Its appearance changes along with the time goes, so make sure you don't miss any of them.

Before you start to move, gather more than 16 logs. You can place a log pile by right-clicking while crouching, and this will help you a lot as a temporary block.

Alternatively, about 1500 kaolin clays[^1] would work for your entire gameplay[^2]. The number is just a rough approximation, so more of them for safety would be better.

## Chopping a Tree
It's good to know that there are two ways to chop a tree: Gregtech and Terrafermacraft. You can get the full return of Gregtech style while being as fast as Terrafirmacraft style.

In Gregtech style, it will take about a minute to chop a tree. In result a fancy animation will played and tons of logs and saplings will be given, especially saplings being hard to get in original Terrafirmacraft. Simply trying to break a log attached to its leaves with an axe while not crouching will activate Gregtech style tree chopping.

Extension of a tree is possible by placing more logs beside of trunk, making it faster to chop it than it would be in Terrafirmacraft style. This is an effective strategy to gather logs in a short time span.

In Terrafirmacraft style, you will chop down a tree blazingly fast, in the expense of less logs, no saplings, and using more durability than Gregtech style. As mentioned above, crouch while breaking a log will activate this style. Logs without attached leaves will be chopped in this style by default.

Tree logs will be used for firpit, pit kiln, and charcoal pit. 

## Clays
Clays are found under specific types of flowers: Athyrium, Canna, Goldenrod, Pampas Grass, Perovskia, and Water Canna. Dig them with shovel you've crafted earlier. You would need at least 30 clays to proceed, but the more you get, the more things you will be able to do.

For every 5 clays you can knap a clay item. The recipes are somewhat inverted version of stone kanpping recipes. Of course, there are new tools unlocked. Unlike stone knapping, clay knapping will not use your all 5 clays even if you fail to finish a recipe. Here's a brief recipe list you need to go.

```

A vessel is a small storage for things. It has 4 slots to put, each capped by 16 items. It is used for metling down some ores, or preserving foods so that they go bad slowly.

A water pot contains enough water to drink once. This will save tons of time finding water or even dying from dehydration.

Molds are for making advanced tools, such as copper or something. They are going to be used until the bronze age.

A ceramic blowpipe protects you from harmful effects, mainly damage from holding too hot items. It has no durability, so earlier, the better. It is also used for glassworking, but the most usage is the one said earlier.

Additionally, you may make either a hammer or a pickaxe mold. They both can be used for mining stones and ores. But don't rush! A hammer can be made from a stone, and it can be used instead of pickaxe. Making ore-level hammer or pickaxe is okay to be delayed until you make an anvil, which gives you a buff in durability and mining speed. It's your choice to make a hammer for durability, since a stone hammer has too small durability of 50.

After creating clay items, you might notice that they are unfired. In order to use them, you should heat them up to Yellow White.

## Pit Kiln
Pit Kiln is a way to heat up things directly to Yellow White ****. You need 8 straws and 8 logs, with enough patience to wait 8 minutes. To do this, dig a small one-block hole and place down the items you want to heat up. There is a special key for placing an item on a block. Normally 4 items are maximum. Place 8 straws and 8 logs on top of them, and set on a fire. You may see the remaining time on top of the screen.

## Charcoal Pit
Charcoal pit is a way to get charcoal. Charcoal is a pretty good fuel, also being a required material for making wrought irons. A better version of forge, charcoal forge, is made up of charcoal as its name suggests, too.

By right-clicking onto a block while holding a log and crouching, you can stack up to 16 logs in a single block. The stack is called a log pile. Setting up a fire on log piles while they cannot access to open air makes them charcoal. This step is called charcoal pit. The simplest shape of charcoal pit would be a log pile in a hole with dirt covered, and common shape would be a 3x3 square. It takes 15 minutes to finish, and gives you roughly ⅓ charcoal per log in return.

## Charcoal Forge
Charcoal can be used to form a charcoal forge. Charcoal forge is an improved way to heat up things. You need 5 stone blocks, including cobblestones, raw stones, and stone bricks. Dig a hole and replace 5 blocks surrounding the hole with stones. Place 7 or 8 charcoal into the hole by right-clicking, and set on a fire onto it. You'll now see that the texture has been changed like a magma block.

Opening the charcoal forge by right-clicking, you'll see there are 10 slots in V shape and 4 slots on the right side vertically. The 10 slots are for items to heat up and fuels, 5 each. Side 4 slots are for containers like vessels, molds, etc. Put 2 or more ingot molds for safety!

## Casting
To make metal items, you should cast them into molds. Casting is done by following steps: put small ores into a vessel and heat them up. After that, open the vessel by right-clicking, and put the mold you want to cast. Alternatively, smelt those ores in charcoal forge, with a ingot mold or a vessel in it. Molten metal will automatically go into the containers.

The first material to make tools would be copper. There must have been some copper ores during the travel, in the form of native copper, tetrahedrite, or malachite. If you haven't find one, go find it.

There's an option to make bronze by alloying copper and tin. This will be covered later, but it is recommended to jump directly to the bronze age.

9 small ores(16mB) translate into 1 ingot/tool(144mB). You will need at least 14 copper ingots for a copper anvil, which is necessary for progression in the primitive age. Even if you start right away from bronze tools, this requirement will not be removed.

The first tool you should make is a saw. Don't make pickaxe! You cannot mine anything without a saw, because of the cave-ins. Moreover, it is better to mine materials with a hammer, which yields almost 7 times much.

## Flux
Flux is a material for welding in an anvil. It can be acquired by crafting stones with hammer, commonly claystone, marble**TODO**, and once-living organisms.

## Anvils
An anvil is a crafting station for forging and welding. Forging is for making tools, and welding is for making double ingots/plates or complex items. Welding recipe usually reuiqres flux. Every tool using better items than bronze must be made in the same or higher tier of anvil.

An anvil has a tier. Starting from stone, it goes along copper, (any) bronze, wrought iron, steel, black steel, and colored steel. Every anvil except for stone one requires 7 double ingots (or 14 ingots) to make, and every progression will involve crafting of new anvil in the primitive age.

To get your first anvil, grab a raw igneous extrusive rock. Raw rocks can be extracted by isolating the rock from any other nearby rocks. Place it down anywhere you want, and right click with a hammer. You now have a stone anvil!

Stone anvil unlocks double copper ingots. Heat up 14 copper ingots until it is able to be welded (Orange *** is recommended). Put two ingots and enough flux in anvil. Right-click the anvil with hammer while crouching, and you'll get a double copper ingot! Repeat this until you have 7 double copper ingots. Place them on crafting table in a I shape, and now you have the first metal anvil!

Everytime you get better materials in the primitive age, you will repeat these steps.

## Alloying Bronze
Simply put, alloying is mixing materials. Some materials require specific ratio of specific materials, and bronze is the first alloy you'll make. There are 3 kinds of bronze: plain bronze with copper and tin, bismuth bronze with copper, bismuth, and zinc, and balck bronze with copper, silver, and gold. As you proceed, you must make all the different bronzes.

In TerrafirmaGreg, the plain bronze will be the best option, which is just a mixture of copper and tin. The required raito of materials can be navigated in the alloying[^3] tab in JEI. More easily, just put some stacks of copper and tin in vessel and hover over it. If it says it forms bronze, heat the vessel in the way you did to copper. One pitfall is that a vessel has its maximum capacity of 3000 mB. Any material more than that will just vanish, so don't be greedy.

After alloying a bronze, cast 46 ingots, 14 for a new anvil, and 32 for a bloomery, which will be covered later. Smelt the previous copper anvil if you want to, noting that it takes ridiculously long time to do.

## Bloomery
It's time to proceed to the iron age, but it is a bit different from before. Because of  the too high amount of carbon, you must smelt them in a bloomery.

A bloomery is made up of 8 double bronze plates. Each plate costs 2 ingots, and each double plate costs 2 plates, so you need 32 bronze ingots to make one. It is a kind of multiblock, requiring at least 21 stone blocks. To form a bloomery, place down a block on which a bloomery door will be put, place one more block in the same y layer,
