<p>TerrafirmaGreg is a modpack which incorporates two major mods, Terrafirmacraft and GregTech, with many other supplementary mods. The former vastly changes your survival experience, adding new systems and terrains and mods and etc., and the latter helps you automate almost (or literally) every element existing. It might be frustrating though, if you don't know enough necessary information to advance. So this guide will let you know how to and what to do things you need to do.</p>

<p>In TerrafirmaGreg, a region has normally 3, sometimes 4 layers of rocks. The rock type of a region determines which ore vains to be generated, so it is important to know the forming of rocks.</p>
<p>The forming of rocks follows this diagram:</p>

<p>Each arrow indicates what rocks usually form underneath it. For example, quartzite is likely to form under chert. The text on arrows between igneous extrusive and intrusive indicates the grade of those rocks.</p>
<p>Sedimentary and igneous extrusive rocks can form in the top layer, and following rocks will form according to the rules above. Ocean floors are made up of igneous extrusive rocks.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are Dikes, which are small lines of igneous intrusive rocks. Dikes works as a sample rock of the deeper layer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="climate"><a class="header" href="#climate">Climate</a></h1>
<p>Climate is an important factor of which plants and animals would live. It is calculated from two factors: temperature and hydration.
Regional temperature is again set by three factors: latitude(Z coordinate), season, and daily time, in which latitude is the strongest. Usually going north(Z -) lowers regional temperature, and south(Z +) increases. It seems that around Z: 5000 is set to be the equator of a world.
Hydration is mainly calculated by longitude(X coordinate). Going east(X +) increases it while going west(X -) decreases.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-health-care"><a class="header" href="#basic-health-care">Basic Health Care</a></h1>
<p>Many kind of things will consistently bother you, namely health, hunger, hydration, and body temperature. Health is self-explanatory, with max health being able to be increased by balanced diet. There are 5 categories of nutrition: Grain, Protein, Fruit, Vegetable, and Dairy. Each food has its own value of nutrients. Since it is hard to maintain being nourished, some options for merging foods like sandwiches or salads are available.</p>
<p>Hunger is something like the amount of actions you can do without dying. When hunger is low, screen becomes greish and you cannot run. Hydration is similar to hunger, but drains a bit faster and requires fresh water. When hydration is low, you'll get low speed and mining fatigue debuff.</p>
<p>Body temperature is by far the most intricate factor; you'll die if body temperature gets higher than 30 Celsius degree(heatstroke), or lower than 0 Celsius degree(froze to death). A small triangle over the hot bar is the indicator of it: blue for cold, red (or orange) for hot. Crouch anywhere and you'll see your current body temperature and target temperature, in the format of <code>15.0℃ -&gt; 13.7℃</code>. This means that if you stay where you are, your body temperature will fall down to 13.7℃. It will rise and fall according to the climate temperature. Additionally, nearby blocks, such as hot stuffs like machines, lava, forge, or cold stuffs like snow, water will increase or decrease your body temperature. Normally, it's best to remain as close as 15℃.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="special-recipes"><a class="header" href="#special-recipes">Special Recipes</a></h1>
<p>There are tons of added ways to craft things. In here, we'll take a glance at what kind of new ways exists.</p>
<h2 id="knapping"><a class="header" href="#knapping">Knapping</a></h2>
<p>Knapping is a special way of shaping things. Holding enough amount of a specific material, right click and knapping UI will appear. In 5x5 knapping UI, you click cells you want to be removed. Failing to make an item will lose the original material, except for clay.</p>
<p>There are four cases in which you knap: stone, clay, leather, and horn. The first two is the most important part of knapping. You can navigate through all the recipes in JEI.</p>
<h2 id="casting"><a class="header" href="#casting">Casting</a></h2>
<p>Casting is a process of putting liquid into molds. Before the wrought iron age, you can cast tools directly. But from the wrought iron age, you can only cast liquid into ingots, requiring forging.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways for casting. With a vessel with molten ore, right-click it and casting UI will be shown. In charcoal forge, molten ore will directly go to the container in the right side. A crucible works like charcoal forge, with more smelting slots and one casting slot.</p>
<h2 id="instant-barrel--barrel-sealing"><a class="header" href="#instant-barrel--barrel-sealing">Instant Barrel / Barrel Sealing</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="tfc-basics/../primitive-age/20250309014151.html">barrel</a> is an item for making a few items. The right-hand slot is where the items go in, and with appropriate liquid and item, the result will be given. There's no worry for losing items: it has invisible slots for excess items. You can retreive all the outputs from the right-hand slot.</p>
<p>Some recipes are instant, like forming limewater with flux, while most of the recipes require some time to be done. Recipes that are not instant require the barrel to be sealed. Otherwise the recipe will not work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-primitive-age"><a class="header" href="#the-primitive-age">The Primitive Age</a></h1>
<p>If you don't want to rumble with any complicated things, here will be the best place to start.</p>
<p>In here, you'll get procedural goals for advancement and brief explanation for what to do. To make things simple, most of the recipes you need are introduced in the form of link, so don't hesitate to navigate through links. The section is made to follow step by step.</p>
<p>The primitive age consists of 6 sub-ages: the copper age, bronze age, wrought iron age, steel age, black steel age, and finally, colored steel age<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. When you reach to the steel age, you'll move to the mechanical/steam age. From that point, your progression will be made in parallel.</p>
<h2 id="basic-health-care-1"><a class="header" href="#basic-health-care-1"><a href="primitive-age/../tfc-basics/20250306152451.html">Basic Health Care</a></a></h2>
<p>While there's no problem to skipping the TFC Basics chapter, you should know about fundamentals for survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>Health: max health changes according to nutritional balance</li>
<li>Hunger: requires foods, cannot run and screen gets greish when low</li>
<li>Hydration: drink fresh water by right-clicking, slow and mining fatigue debuff when low</li>
<li>Body temperature: triangle indicator over hot bar; red screen when hot, blue screen when low; heatstroke over 30℃, froze to death under 0℃, 15℃ best</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know how to survive, let's start our journey!</p>
<h2 id="stone-tools"><a class="header" href="#stone-tools"><a href="primitive-age/../primitive-age/20250306153529.html">Stone Tools</a></a></h2>
<p>Make stone axe and knife.</p>
<p>To make stone tools, pick up some wood sticks and stones fallen around. Make stone tool heads by <a href="primitive-age/../tfc-basics/20250308173354.html#knapping">knapping</a>, which can be done by right-clicking while holding two or more rocks, and craft them with sticks to get stone tools. Stone axe is for chopping a tree, and stone knife is for gathering thatch, which is used for pit kiln.</p>
<p>With those tool heads, place them vertically to make stone tools. Congratulations! You now have a fundamental tools to start.</p>
<p>Also, as soon as you've chosen where to live, start <a href="primitive-age/../primitive-age/20250307010726.html">farming</a> by making a stone hoe. You will need crops for hunger management and animal husbandary.</p>
<h2 id="thatch-bed"><a class="header" href="#thatch-bed"><a href="primitive-age/../primitive-age/20250307015405.html#thatch-bed">Thatch Bed</a></a></h2>
<p>Create a thatch bed for setting spawnpoint.</p>
<p>A thatch bed allows you to set spawnpoint, while you cannot skip through night.</p>
<p>A wool bed will enable you to skip through night. It requires spindle, saw, and wooly animals with enough familiarity.</p>
<h2 id="kaolin-clay"><a class="header" href="#kaolin-clay"><a href="primitive-age/../primitive-age/20250308163610.html#kaolinite-powder">Kaolin Clay</a>?</a></h2>
<p>It is strongly recommended to find kaolin clay, or at least where it is, before you make a house.</p>
<p>Before you start your journey, gather more than 16 logs. You can place a log pile by right-clicking while crouching, and this will help you a lot as a temporary block.</p>
<p>Alternatively, about 1500 kaolin clays<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> would work for your entire gameplay<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. The number is just a rough approximation, so more of them for safety would be better.</p>
<h2 id="chopping-a-tree"><a class="header" href="#chopping-a-tree">Chopping a Tree</a></h2>
<p>Get some logs and sticks with stone axe.</p>
<p>It's good to know that there are two styles to chop a tree: Gregtech and Terrafermacraft style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gregtech style
<ul>
<li>Condition: break a log attached to leaves while not crouching</li>
<li>Time: determined by the number of logs vertically attached</li>
<li>Durability Cost: 1</li>
<li>Output: logs, sticks, tree saplings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Terrafirmacraft style
<ul>
<li>Condition: break a log while crouching, or break a log not attached to leaves</li>
<li>Time: about 5 seconds</li>
<li>Durability Cost: the amount of logs you get</li>
<li>Output: logs only</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Extend a tree by placing the same type of log beside a tree. This will cut the time it takes by a fifth.</p>
<p>Tree logs will be used for firpit, pit kiln, charcoal pit, and more.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-fire"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-fire">Starting a Fire</a></h2>
<p>Make a firestarter by crafting two sticks diagonally.</p>
<p>A firestarter is literally a tool for starting a fire. This is used until the steel age where you can get flint and steel.</p>
<h2 id="charcoal-pit"><a class="header" href="#charcoal-pit">Charcoal Pit</a></h2>
<p>Make characoal pit by placing 144 logs in a 3x3 block, light them up, and cover them with dirt.</p>
<p>By right-clicking onto a block with a log while crouching, you can stack up to 16 logs in a single block. The stack is called a log pile. Setting up a fire on log piles while they cannot access to open air makes them charcoal. This structure is called charcoal pit. The simplest shape of charcoal pit would be a log pile in a hole with dirt covered, and common shape would be a 3x3 square. It takes 15 minutes to finish, and gives you roughly ⅓ charcoal per log in return.</p>
<p>Charcoal is a pretty good fuel and a essential material for making wrought irons. Also, charcoal forge, a better way to heat items, is made up of charcoal, as its name suggests.</p>
<h2 id="clay-items"><a class="header" href="#clay-items"><a href="primitive-age/../primitive-age/20250308175403.html">Clay Items</a></a></h2>
<p>Make unfired small vessel, water pot, saw blade mold, ingot mold, and ceramic blowpipe by knapping.</p>
<p>Clay is found under specific types of flowers<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. Dig them with shovel you've crafted earlier. After getting clay, knap them. Clay knapping recipe is similar to inverted stone knapping recipe, with some added tools. It costs 5 clay per recipe and does not consume clay even if you fail to make one.</p>
<p>A vessel is a small storage for things. It has 4 slots to put, each capped by 16 items. It is used for metling down some ores, or preserving foods so that they go bad slowly. A water pot contains enough water to drink once. This will save tons of time finding water or even dying from dehydration. Molds are for making advanced tools, such as copper or something. They are going to be used until the bronze age. A ceramic blowpipe protects you from harmful effects, mainly damage from holding too hot items. It has no durability, so earlier, the better. It is also used for glassworking, but the most usage is the one said earlier.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may make either a hammer or a pickaxe mold. They both can be used for mining stones and ores. But don't rush! A hammer can be made from a stone, and it can be used instead of pickaxe. Making ore-level hammer or pickaxe is okay to be delayed until you make an anvil, which gives you a buff in durability and mining speed. It's your choice to make a hammer for durability, since a stone hammer has too small durability of 50.</p>
<p>You might notice that the items you've just made are unfired. In order to use them, you should heat them up to Yellow White.</p>
<h2 id="pit-kiln"><a class="header" href="#pit-kiln"><a href="primitive-age/../primitive-age/20250309022123.html#pit-kiln">Pit Kiln</a></a></h2>
<p>Using pit kiln, heat up items you've made in the previous section.</p>
<p>Pit kiln is made up of 8 thatch, which can be acquired by breaking grass with a knife, and 8 logs. Place down up to four items in a hole, put 8 thatch, put 8 logs, and start a fire. After 8 minutes, items will be heated up to Yellow White ****.</p>
<h2 id="casting-1"><a class="header" href="#casting-1"><a href="primitive-age/../tfc-basics/20250308173354.html#casting">Casting</a></a></h2>
<p>Cast tool heads by putting 9 or more small copper into a vessel, heating up the vessel, opening it, and putting the tool head molds into it. Alternatively, put appropriate amount of small copper in the left side of charcoal forge and tool head molds in right, and start a fire.</p>
<p>The first material to make tools would be copper. There must have been some copper ores during the travel, in the form of native copper, tetrahedrite, or malachite. If you haven't find one, go find it.</p>
<p>There's an option to make bronze by <a href="primitive-age/20250225014717.html#alloying-bronze">alloying</a> copper and tin. While it might be frustrating, it is recommended to jump directly to the bronze age.</p>
<p>9 small ores(16mB) translate into 1 ingot/tool(144mB). You will need at least 14 copper ingots for a copper anvil, which is necessary for progression in the primitive age. Even if you start right away from bronze tools, this requirement will not be removed.</p>
<p>The first tool you should make is a saw. Don't make pickaxe! You cannot mine anything without a saw, because of the cave-ins. Moreover, it is better to mine materials with a hammer, which yields almost 7 times much.</p>
<h2 id="flux"><a class="header" href="#flux">Flux</a></h2>
<p>Get enough amount of flux. 4 sets are recommended.</p>
<p>Flux is a material for welding in an anvil. It can be acquired by crafting fluxstones<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup> with hammer, and once-living organisms.</p>
<h2 id="anvils"><a class="header" href="#anvils">Anvils</a></h2>
<p>An anvil is a crafting station for forging and welding. Forging is for making tools, and welding is for making double ingots/plates or complex items. Welding recipe usually reuiqres flux. Every tool using better items than bronze must be made in the same or higher tier of anvil.</p>
<p>An anvil has a tier. Starting from stone, it goes along copper, (any) bronze, wrought iron, steel, black steel, and colored steel. Every anvil except for stone one requires 7 double ingots (or 14 ingots) to make, and every progression will involve crafting of new anvil in the primitive age.</p>
<p>To get your first anvil, grab a raw igneous extrusive rock. Raw rocks can be extracted by isolating the rock from any other nearby rocks. Place it down anywhere you want, and right click with a hammer. You now have a stone anvil!</p>
<p>Stone anvil unlocks double copper ingots. Heat up 14 copper ingots until it is able to be welded (Orange *** is recommended). Put two ingots and enough flux in anvil. Right-click the anvil with hammer while crouching, and you'll get a double copper ingot! Repeat this until you have 7 double copper ingots. Place them on crafting table in a I shape, and now you have the first metal anvil!</p>
<p>Everytime you get better materials in the primitive age, you will repeat these steps.</p>
<h2 id="alloying-bronze"><a class="header" href="#alloying-bronze">Alloying Bronze</a></h2>
<p>Simply put, alloying is mixing materials. Some materials require specific ratio of specific materials, and bronze is the first alloy you'll make. There are 3 kinds of bronze: plain bronze with copper and tin, bismuth bronze with copper, bismuth, and zinc, and balck bronze with copper, silver, and gold. As you proceed, you must make all the different bronzes.</p>
<p>In TerrafirmaGreg, the plain bronze will be the best option, which is just a mixture of copper and tin. The required raito of materials can be navigated in the alloying<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> tab in JEI. More easily, just put some stacks of copper and tin in vessel and hover over it. If it says it forms bronze, heat the vessel in the way you did to copper. One pitfall is that a vessel has its maximum capacity of 3000 mB. Any material more than that will just vanish, so don't be greedy.</p>
<p>After alloying a bronze, cast 46 ingots, 14 for a new anvil, and 32 for a bloomery, which will be covered later. Smelt the previous copper anvil if you want to, noting that it takes ridiculously long time to do.</p>
<h2 id="bloomery"><a class="header" href="#bloomery">Bloomery</a></h2>
<p>It's time to proceed to the iron age, but it is a bit different from before. Because of  the too high amount of carbon, you must smelt them in a bloomery.</p>
<p>A bloomery is made up of 8 double bronze plates. Each plate costs 2 ingots, and each double plate costs 2 plates, so you need 32 bronze ingots to make one. It is a kind of multiblock, requiring at least 21 stone blocks. To form a bloomery, place down a block on which a bloomery door will be put, place one more block in the same y layer,</p>

<p>In TerrafirmaGreg, there's two options for place to sleep: a thatch bed and a wool bed. Since it is hard to get wools, a thatch bed would be the only option in early-game. Being easy to make, you cannot sleep through night with it. A wool bed does not have this disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="thatch-bed-1"><a class="header" href="#thatch-bed-1">Thatch Bed</a></h2>
<p>A thatch bed is an early-game solution for spawnpoint. It consists of 2 thatch blocks, which are just 4 straws combined, and large raw hide, which can be acquired from big predators. To form a thatch bed, place down 2 thatch blocks consequtively, and right-click with large raw hide onto it. It will show a toast text that "This bed is too uncomfortable to sleep, but your spawnpoint was set." You can die from countlessly many things in here, so grab it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Fire clay is a main material for a crucible and blast furnace, which are necessary for progression into the steel age.</p>
<p>One fire clay is made up of 4 kaolinite powder, 4 graphite dust, and 1 clay. With 5 fire clay, you can make one item by <a href="primitive-age/./primitive-age/20250306153529.html#clay-knapping">knapping</a>.</p>
<h2 id="kaolinite-powder"><a class="header" href="#kaolinite-powder">Kaolinite Powder</a></h2>
<p>Kaolinite powder can be made by heating up kaolin clay, with the chance of 20%. The best way to do this is putting 4 sets of kaolin clay in 4 small vessels, and heating them up by pit kiln.</p>
<p>Kaolin clay is found in region whose temperature is over 18℃ and rainfall is over 300mm. It also requires high altitude with Plateaus, Old Mountains, Rolling Hills, and Highlands biome. Blood lily is the indicator of kaolin clay. Its appearance changes along with the time goes, so make sure you don't miss any of them.</p>
<p>Normally, going south east will increase average temparautre and annual rainfall.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to heat up things. This section will cover all the ways that generates heat.</p>
<h2 id="pit-kiln-1"><a class="header" href="#pit-kiln-1">Pit Kiln</a></h2>
<p>Pit Kiln is a way to heat up things directly to Yellow White ****. You need 8 straws and 8 logs, with enough patience to wait 8 minutes. Dig a small one-block hole and place down the items you want to heat up. There is a special key for placing an item on a block. Normally 4 items are maximum. Place 8 straws and 8 logs on top of them, and set on a fire. You may see the remaining time on top of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="charcoal-forge"><a class="header" href="#charcoal-forge">Charcoal Forge</a></h2>
<p>Charcoal forge is an improved way to heat up things. You need 5 stone blocks, including cobblestones, raw stones, and stone bricks. Dig a hole and replace 5 blocks surrounding the hole with stones. Place 7 or 8 charcoal into the hole by right-clicking, and set on a fire onto it. You'll now see that the texture has been changed like a magma block.</p>
<p>Opening the charcoal forge by right-clicking, you'll see there are 10 slots in V shape and 4 slots on the right side vertically. The 10 slots are for items to heat up and fuels, 5 each. Side 4 slots are for containers like vessels, molds, etc. Put 2 or more ingot molds for safety!</p>
